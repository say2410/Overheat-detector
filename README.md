# Overheat Detector 🌡️🚨

Efficient overheat detector using Arduino, sensors, and an alarm system to alert the user about an overheated system. Take timely actions to prevent potential issues. The system can also be used to monitor room temperature, activating the alarm if it exceeds the required threshold.

## Features 🚀

- **Temperature Monitoring:**
  - Continuous monitoring of the machine's temperature using a dedicated sensor.

- **Threshold Trigger:**
  - Arduino code sets a specified threshold for temperature triggering.

- **Buzzer Alarm:**
  - Activates a buzzer alarm when the temperature exceeds the threshold.
  - Buzzer remains silent within the defined threshold.

- **LED Indication:**
  - Includes an LED indicator.
  - Red LED illuminates when the temperature exceeds the threshold.

- **Interactive Response:**
  - Provides a responsive system with visual (LED) and auditory (buzzer) feedback.

- **Customizable Threshold:**
  - Easily customize the temperature threshold based on specific requirements.

- **Arduino Integration:**
  - Implemented using Arduino programming for versatility across different systems.

- **Real-time Monitoring:**
  - Offers real-time temperature monitoring for timely interventions.
